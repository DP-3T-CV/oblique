<p>Adds <code>control-mandatory</code> class to highlight required elements. Also controls the <code>has-error</code> class to style the component in case of errors</p>
<p>Required elements will be discovery by either <code>required</code> attribute on the related form control, <code>mandatory</code> input on the directive or <code>ngControl.errors.required</code> error on the related form control.</p>
<p>Works well with the <code>or-error-messages</code> component which displays the errors.</p>

	<h2>Deprecated with Material Design</h2>
	<p>If Oblique's theme hasn't been changed to Bootstrap, the <a href="https://material.angular.io/components/form-field/overview#error-messages">Angular implementation</a> should be preferred.</p>
	<p>As a deprecated component, it is not likely to receive any new features or improvements.</p>
	<p>This component won't be removed as long as Bootstrap is still supported.</p>
</div>
