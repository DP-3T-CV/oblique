<p>This component offers a nice way to display error messages related to a form element and is works best when used with
	the <code>orFormControlState</code> directive.</p>
<p>If used within the <code>orFormControlState</code> directive, the component will automatically display the errors of
	the related control. In that case, the errors will be displayed in red, thanks to the <code>has-error</code> class
	set by the directive.</p>
<p>When used outside of the <code>orFormControlState</code> directive, the component can be placed anywhere on the page
	but then the source control has to be specified through the <code>control</code> input. In that case, no styling
	will be applied to the content.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning material-only">
	<h2>Deprecated</h2>
