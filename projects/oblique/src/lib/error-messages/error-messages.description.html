<p>This component offers a nice way to display error messages related to a form element and is works best when used with the <code>orFormControlState</code> directive.</p>
<p>If used within the <code>orFormControlState</code> directive, the component will automatically display the errors of the related control. In that case, the errors will be displayed in red, thanks to the <code>has-error</code> class set by the directive.</p>
<p>When used outside of the <code>orFormControlState</code> directive, the component can be placed anywhere on the page but then the source control has to be specified through the <code>control</code> input. In that case, no styling will be applied to the content.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
	<h2>Deprecated with Material Design</h2>
	<p>If Oblique's theme hasn't been changed to Bootstrap, the <a href="https://material.angular.io/components/form-field/overview#error-messages">Angular implementation</a> should be preferred.</p>
	<p>As a deprecated component, it is not likely to receive any new features or improvements.</p>
	<p>This component won't be removed as long as Bootstrap is still supported.</p>
</div>
