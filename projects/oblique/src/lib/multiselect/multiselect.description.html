	<h2>Deprecated with Material Design</h2>
	<p>If Oblique's theme hasn't been changed to Bootstrap, the <a href="https://material.angular.io/components/select/overview#multiple-selection">Angular implementation</a> should be preferred.</p>
	<p>As a deprecated component, it is not likely to receive any new features or improvements.</p>
	<p>This component won't be removed as long as Bootstrap is still supported.</p>
