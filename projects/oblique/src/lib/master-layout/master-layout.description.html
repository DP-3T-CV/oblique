<p>This component takes care of the page's structure. It contains the header and footer, manages off-canvas and spinner,
	and displays notifications. It is fully live configurable and its default values can be tweaked through the <code>MasterLayoutConfig</code>
	injectable. Thanks to the <code>MasterLayoutComponent</code> and its sub-components, <code>Gulp</code> and
	<code>Handlebars</code> have been completely removed from business projects.</p>
<p>Project that already features the <code>MasterLayoutComponent</code> should refer to the changelog for breaking
	changes.</p>
