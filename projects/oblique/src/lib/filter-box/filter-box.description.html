<p>The FilterBox component provides a filter-like UI input with text content clearing. It exposes a filter pattern, which gets linked to your view component
	property using the <code>[(pattern)]</code> attribute.</p>
<p>You can prepend or append using content projection through the selectors listed on the API documentation below.</p>
<p>Note that this component only provides a filtering pattern. Elements to be filtered and filtering logic need to be implemented by your view component!</p>
