<p>This is an internal feature of Oblique and should only be used when live theme or font change is required. The vast majority of projects won't need this
	service and should just stick to the configuration options.</p>
<p>The desired theme, either <code>oblique-material</code> or <code>oblique-bootstrap</code>, should simply be set in <code>angular.json</code>, after <code>oblique-core.css</code>.
	To avoid theme conflicts, either define a theme in <code>angular.json</code> or set it through the <code>setTheme</code> method. Doing both will lead to
	load 2 separate themes simultaneously which will lead to unpredictable results.<p>
<p>The theme service tries to load the <strong>Frutiger</strong> font per default. This can be altered by injecting the <code>OBLIQUE_FONT</code> token with the
	desired font into the providers array of <code>app.module.ts</code>. Both <code>Frutiger</code> and <code>Roboto</code> are served statically, which means a
	reference to its definition will be automatically loaded and injected into the <code>HEAD</code> of the HTML document. If <code>OBLIOQUE.FONT</code> is set
	to <code>FONTS.NONE</code>, no font definition will be loaded, which results in <code>Arial</code> being used.</p>
<p>Because of licence restrictions, the <code>Frutiger</code> font files cannot be delivered with Oblique. Each project has to obtain the font files itself from
	<a href="mailto:webforum@bk.admin.ch">webforum@bk.admin.ch</a> or the
	<a href="https://intranet.bk.admin.ch/bk-intra/de/home/dl-koordination-bund/kommunikation/webforum-bund/Downloads.html">federal chancellery intranet</a> and
	put them into the <code>src/assets/fonts</code> folder. Each project is also responsible for the font protection according to its
	<a href="https://github.com/swiss/styleguide/blob/master/src/assets/fonts/LICENSE">licence</a>. The proposed solution consist of only delivering the font if
	the <code>Referer</code> Http header is whitelisted.
