<p>The themes service allows the live switching between <strong>Material</strong> and <strong>Bootstrap</strong> themes. It even accepts custom themes.
	The given theme will be automatically loaded and applied.</p>
<p>This feature should only be used when live theme change is required. Otherwise, simply load the desired theme in <code>angular.json</code></p>
<p>Per default, Oblique tries to load <strong>Frutiger</strong>. But because of licence restrictions, those files cannot
	be delivered with Oblique. Each project has to obtain the font files form <a href="mailto:webforum@bk.admin.ch">webforum@bk.admin.ch</a>
	and to protect them according to the licence. The proposed solution consist of only delivering the font if the
	<code>Referer</code> Http header is whitelisted.
